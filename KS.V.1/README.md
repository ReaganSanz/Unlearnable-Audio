<h2> Issues/Incomplete </h2>
1. Min-min function and PGD attack may correct, but theres a loop error/something wrong with the models training thats causing it to not update the LR and error
2. Formatting isn't the best - will be updated after model is finished and starting testing
3. Variables may not be consistent for updating calculations, may be the issue with training 

<h2> Currently Working On </h2>
1. Redoing model training to get rid of error loop 
2. Readjusting variables (especially step & epoch_num) 
3. Redoing section that calculates error rates and learning rates
